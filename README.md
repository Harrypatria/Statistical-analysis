### Statistical data analysis

This tutorial was written by Dr. Harry Patria https://github.com/Harrypatria for MasterClass conducted by Patria & Co, PT. Strategi Transforma Infiniti.

This version has been adapted for Colab. It runs Python3 by default.

Some or most of you have probably taken some undergraduate- or graduate-level statistics courses. Unfortunately, the curricula for most introductory statisics courses are mostly focused on conducting statistical hypothesis tests as the primary means for interest: t-tests, chi-squared tests, analysis of variance, etc. Such tests seek to esimate whether groups or effects are "statistically significant", a concept that is poorly understood, and hence often misused, by most practioners. Even when interpreted correctly, statistical significance is a questionable goal for statistical inference, as it is of limited utility.

A far more powerful approach to statistical analysis involves building flexible models with the overarching aim of estimating quantities of interest. This section of the tutorial illustrates how to use Python to build statistical models of low to moderate difficulty from scratch, and use them to extract estimates and associated measures of uncertainty

### Stages

Statistical data modeling involves building mathematical models to describe and analyze relationships within data.

- The first step in statistical data modeling is to define the research question or problem, including the variables of interest and the appropriate statistical method to use.

- Data cleaning and preparation are important steps in statistical data modeling, which may involve removing outliers, handling missing data, and transforming variables.

- The statistical model is fitted by selecting the appropriate model type and estimating the model parameters using statistical software.

- Goodness of fit evaluation involves assessing how well the model fits the data and whether it meets the assumptions of the statistical method.

- Measures such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared), residual plots, and diagnostic tests can be used to evaluate the model's goodness of fit.

- The final step in statistical data modeling is to use the model to make predictions or estimate quantities of interest, which may involve predicting future outcomes, identifying significant predictors, or estimating the effect of a particular variable.

Statistical data modeling is a powerful tool for exploring, analyzing, and making predictions about data, providing researchers and practitioners with valuable insights into complex data sets.

Common types of statistical models include linear regression, logistic regression, time series models, and machine learning models.

Choosing the appropriate statistical model and method depends on the research question, the nature of the data, and the goals of the analysis.
